# Azad & Sons
Website for a furniture business

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- SCSS
- npm

## Installing Modules
- Clone or download the project.
- Open Terminal.
- Run 'npm install' and all the modules will be downloaded.

## Modifying Styles
- All node_modules should be installed
- Don't modify css/style.css. Write CSS styles inside scss/style.scss.
- In order to compile SCSS to CSS, run `npm run watch:scss` and they will be compiled to style.css.
- Concat CSS files by running `npm run concat:css`. The styles will be applied to to style.concat.css.
- Minify style.concat.css. Copy the whole minified code and overwrite the code inside style.min.css. (I was feeling lazy and instead of writing a script, I just minified using a website :D)
